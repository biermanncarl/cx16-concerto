Components are the elemental building blocks of the graphical user interface,
like buttons, checkboxes, number edits etc.

Each component gets its own file in the components folder. Documentation on
what is expected of each component is given in components/example.asm.

After that, the component has to be registered in one or several configs
in the configs folder (at least the one which you are actively using).
