Guide for folks used to synths
------------------------------

If you have used a lot of synthesizers, most of CONCERTO will be familiar to you.
In order for you to be able to feel right at home, there are some things you should
know, because they may be at first be irritating to experienced synth users.

  * Envelope rates instead of times. Attack, Decay and Release specify the slopes,
    with which the envelope approaches its "destination". The higher the setting,
    the faster the envelope.
  * Fine tuning. Some edits appear with a dot next to the number.
    The dot indicates that this edit can be fine tuned. Fine tuning is done
    by dragging while holding the right mouse button, whereas coarse tuning
    is done by dragging while holding the left mouse button, as usual.
  * Master Envelope. Envelope 1 is the master envelope. That means that as soon as
    Envelope 1 has reached level 0 during the release phase (i.e. after a note-off
    event), the whole voice will be turned off. Essentially, Envelope 1 controls
    how long the voice will be audible.
  * There are hard and soft note-offs. Soft note-offs put the voice into the release
    phase. Hard note-offs turn the voice off immediately. A hard note-off can also
    be used during the release phase (after a soft note-off).
